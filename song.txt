"Three Little Birds"
(feat. The Wailers)

"Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right
Singin': "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right!"

Rise up this mornin'
Smile with the risin' sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Sayin', ("This is my message to you-ou-ou")

Singin': "Don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right"
Singin': "Don't worry (don't worry) 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right!"
